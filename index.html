<p><h4>Do you remember the Xiaomi Mi Max series phones? Yes, the Xiaomi phones with a huge display and a massive battery? Two versions of the phone launched in India until 2017 but the last model, which is the Mi Max 3, never made it to our shores despite its launch in China. Now, it appears that Xiaomi has killed the Mi Max series forever, i.e. no more new Mi Max model coming up, at least for the foreseeable future.</h4></p>
                          <p>According to a recent post on Weibo made by Redmi General Manager Lu Weibing, Xiaomi will not launch any Mi Max series phone. This was previously hinted by Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun a few months ago when he confirmed they have no plans to launch a new Mi Max series phone anytime soon. Weibing has not mentioned any reason behind his statement but it appears that Xiaomi might have pulled the plug on the Max series phones.</p>
          
                          <p>The last Mi Max branded phone was the Mi Max 3 and it launched in China as a bloated Redmi Note 5 Pro with a massive display and a bigger battery. Xiaomi launched the first two models of the Mi Max series in India a couple of years ago. The Mi Max came in 2016 whereas the Mi Max 2 arrived in 2017 as a bigger Redmi Note 4 with a massive display and a premium build quality. The Mi Max phones were essentially all about big screens with midrange specifications at affordable prices.</p>
          
                          <p> screens are still in fashion but these days, regular phones are getting bigger displays that match the ones from the previous generation. For example, the Redmi Note 8 Pro comes with a massive 6.5-inch display, which is only a tad smaller than the 6.9-inch display on the Mi Max 3 from last year. For most consumers, a 6.5-inch display is more than enough for watching videos or playing games. And with the advent of display notches or pop-up cameras, phone displays have started to get increasingly slimmer bezels all around.</p>
                        
<p><h4>WhatsApp has been aggressively pursuing the dream of introducing dark theme on to its Android based app. In the past couple of months we have seen the Facebook-owned social messaging app inching closer to rolling out the feature to its users by redesigning the entire app in dark theme one section at a time. Now we have more evidence to believe that the company is closer to rolling out this feature on its apps at least on the beta version of its Android app.</h4></p>
                           <p>WhatsApp has resigned new sections of its Android based app in the dark mode. According to a report by WABeta Info the company has redesigned icons and call screen window in the dark theme. The screenshots of the dark theme shared by the blogsite show how the image avatars will look in the company&#39;s Android app when the dark theme is enabled. At present the icons for broadcast messages, group chat and individual chat contain off-white icons that sit in the middle of a green-ish circle. When the dark theme is enabled, this green background will be replaced by a dark background.</p>
           
                           <p>Similarly, the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) screen or simply the voice calling window in the popular social messaging app will get a dark treatment, albiet a bit differently. The report states that the light green colour of the voice calling screen will be replaced by a darker shade of green. Notably, these might look like tiny insignificant changes but these changes go a long way in making the final blocks of the social messaging app when the dark theme is finally rolled out to the users.</p>
           
                           <p>Separately, WhatsApp is likely to offer three theme options to the users. Besides the existing light and the new dark theme, the company is likely to offer a third option that will act more like a transitory option between the two themes. In Android 10 powered smartphones, the company is likely to offer a System Default option in the Themes setting which will automatically set the theme of the app based on your phone&#39;s overall settings. In Android phones that are running on Android 9 or older versions of Google&#39;s mobile OS, the company is likely to offer a Battery Saver option that will use your phone&#39;s battery saver settings as a reference point to automatically switch between the light and the dark themes.</p>
